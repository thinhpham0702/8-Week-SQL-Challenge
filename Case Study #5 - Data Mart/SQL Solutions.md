# ðŸ›’Case Study #5 - Data Mart

## Data Exploration
**1. What day of the week is used for each week_date value?**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT to_char(week_date,'Day') day_of_week
FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales;
```

#### Output:
| day_of_week |
|-------------|
| Monday      |

- Monday is used for each week_date value

**2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM generate_series(1,52) 
WHERE generate_series NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT week_number FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales)
```

#### Output:
| generate_series |
|-----------------|
| 1               |
| 2               |
| 3               |

| 11              |
| 12              |
| 37              |
| 38              |
| 39              |
| 40              |
| 41              |
| 42              |
| 43              |
| 44              |
| 45              |
| 46              |
| 47              |
| 48              |
| 49              |
| 50              |
| 51              |
| 52              |

- Range 1 from 12 and range 37 from 52 are missing 

**3. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?**

```sql
SELECT calendar_year
	, SUM(transactions) AS total_transaction
FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

#### Output:
| calendar_year | total_transaction |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 2018          | 346406460         |
| 2019          | 365639285         |

**4. What is the total sales for each region for each month?**

```sql
SELECT region
	, month_number
	, SUM(sales) AS total_sale
FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2;
```

#### Output:

## Before & After Analysis
Taking the week_date value of 2020-06-15 as the baseline week where the Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect.

We would include all week_date values for 2020-06-15 as the start of the period after the change and the previous week_date values would be before.

**1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?**

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE total_sale_per_week_2020 AS (
	SELECT week_date
		, week_number
		, SUM(sales) AS total_sale
	FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
	WHERE calendar_year = 2020
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 2,1
	);

-- 2020-06-15 is week 25
SELECT *
	, after - before AS sale_change
	, ROUND(100.0*(after - before)/before,2) AS change_rate 
FROM (
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN total_sale END) AS before
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sale END) AS after
	FROM total_sale_per_week_2020
	) AS t1;
```

#### Output:
| before     | after      | sale_change | change_rate |
|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2345878357 | 2318994169 | -26884188   | -1.15       |

- There was a slight decrease in sales by 1.15% after Data Mart sustainable packaging changes came into effect

**2. What about the entire 12 weeks before and after?**

```sql
SELECT *
	, after - before AS sale_change
	, ROUND(100.0*(after - before)/before,2) AS change_rate 
FROM (
	SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sale END) AS before
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN total_sale END) AS after
	FROM total_sale_per_week_2020
	) AS t1
```

#### Output:
| before     | after      | sale_change | change_rate |
|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 7126273147 | 6973947753 | -152325394  | -2.14       |

- Sales dropped by 2.14% in the 12-week period after Data Mart performed sustainable packaging changes compared to the 12-week period before the changes.

**3. How do the sale metrics for these 2 periods before and after compare with the previous years in 2018 and 2019?**

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE total_sale_per_week AS (
	SELECT calendar_year
		, week_number
		, SUM(sales) AS total_sale
	FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 2,1
	);

-- 4 weeks before and after week 25th	
SELECT *
	, after - before AS sale_change
	, ROUND(100.0*(after - before)/before,2) AS change_rate 
FROM (
	SELECT calendar_year
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 21 AND 24 THEN total_sale END) AS before
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 28 THEN total_sale END) AS after
	FROM total_sale_per_week
	GROUP BY 1
	) AS t1;
```

#### Output:
| calendar_year | before     | after      | sale_change | change_rate |
|---------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2018          | 2125140809 | 2129242914 | 4102105     | 0.19        |
| 2019          | 2249989796 | 2252326390 | 2336594     | 0.10        |
| 2020          | 2345878357 | 2318994169 | -26884188   | -1.15       |

```sql
-- entire 12 weeks before and after week 25th
SELECT *
	, after - before AS sale_change
	, ROUND(100.0*(after - before)/before,2) AS change_rate 
FROM (
	SELECT calendar_year
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sale END) AS before
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN total_sale END) AS after
	FROM total_sale_per_week
	GROUP BY 1
	) AS t1;
```

#### Output:
| calendar_year | before     | after      | sale_change | change_rate |
|---------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2018          | 6396562317 | 6500818510 | 104256193   | 1.63        |
| 2019          | 6883386397 | 6862646103 | -20740294   | -0.30       |
| 2020          | 7126273147 | 6973947753 | -152325394  | -2.14       |

- In 2018, after the changes, sales increased by 1.63%
- In the other hand, in 2019 and 2020, Data Mart saw a decrease in sales by 0.3% and 2.14, respectively.
- It could be seen that customers prefered the previous version packaging or they were not aware of the changes.
  
## Bonus Question
**Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?**
- region
- platform
- age_band
- demographic
- customer_type

### - region

```sql
WITH region_sale AS (
	SELECT region
		, week_number
		, SUM(sales) AS total_sale
	FROM data_mart.clean_weekly_sales
	WHERE calendar_year = 2020
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 2,1
	)
	
SELECT *
	, after - before AS sale_change
	, ROUND(100.0*(after - before)/before,2) AS change_rate
FROM (
	SELECT region
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN total_sale END) AS before
		, SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN total_sale END) AS after
	FROM region_sale
	GROUP BY 1
	) AS t1
ORDER BY sale_change
```
