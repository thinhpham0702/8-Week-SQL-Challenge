## üéØ Business Task
- Danny was attracted by an idea ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù while he was scrolling through his Instagram feed. He thought that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire, therefore, he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!
- However, Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist, he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.
- He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

## Data Cleaning

### Table: Customer_orders 

First, take a look at `customer_orders` table, as we can see:
- In `exclusions` and `extras` columns, there are some blank spaces and null string.

From the above table, we need to:
- Create temporary table for customer_orders
- Replace all blank and null string with NULL value for consistency
- To be able to uniquely identify each pizza ordered, we have to add an `record_id` column

```sql
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT order_id 
 , customer_id 
 , pizza_id 
 , CASE WHEN exclusions LIKE '%null%' OR exclusions = '' THEN NULL
		ELSE exclusions END AS exclusions
 , CASE WHEN extras LIKE '%null%' OR extras = '' THEN NULL
	  	ELSE extras END AS extras
 , order_time
 , row_number() OVER (ORDER BY order_id) record_id
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```

Second, we notice that both columns are related to `topping_id` column from `pizza_topping` table so they are in wrong data type, our solutions are:
- Create temporary table for extras and exclusions.
- Splitting the exclusions & extras comma delimited lists into rows
- Transform their data type for consistency

```sql
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.extras AS
SELECT record_id
 , TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(extras, ','))) AS extras
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp;

ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.extras
 ALTER COLUMN extras TYPE int USING extras::int;
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.exclusions AS
SELECT record_id
 , TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(exclusions, ','))) AS exclusions
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders_temp;

ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.exclusions
 ALTER COLUMN exclusions TYPE int USING exclusions::int;
```

### Table: Runner_orders

First, take a look at `runner_orders` table, as we can see:
- In `pickup_time`, `distance`, `duration` and `cancellation` columns, there are some blank spaces and null string.

<img src= "https://github.com/thinhpham0702/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/136966635/80b2467f-3009-4dda-8509-ade3978aca02" alt="Image">

From the above table, we need to:
- Create temporary table for runner_orders
- Replace all blank and null string with NULL value for consistency
- Remove 'km' from `distance` column
- Remove 'mins', 'minute' and 'minutes' from `duration` column
- Changing date type for `pickup_time`, `distance` and `duration` columns for consistency.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT order_id
 , runner_id  
 , CASE WHEN pickup_time LIKE '%null%' OR pickup_time = '' THEN NULL
		ELSE pickup_time END AS pickup_time
 , CASE WHEN distance LIKE '%null%' OR distance = '' THEN NULL
	  	WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(distance, 'km', ''))
		ELSE distance END AS distance
 , CASE WHEN duration LIKE '%null%' OR duration = '' THEN NULL
		WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'mins', ''))
		WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minute', ''))
		WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minutes', ''))
		ELSE duration END AS duration
 , CASE WHEN cancellation LIKE '%null%' OR cancellation = '' THEN NULL
		ELSE cancellation END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
```
```sql
ALTER TABLE pizza_runner.runner_orders_temp
 ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE timestamp USING pickup_time::timestamp,
 ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE float USING distance::float,
 ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE int USING duration::int;
```

### Table: Pizza_recipes

First, take a look at `pizza_recipes` table, as we can see:
- In `toppings` column, there is a list of topping_id for each pizza_id separated by comma.

<img src= "https://github.com/thinhpham0702/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/136966635/0da60f42-a580-4405-9d17-9c876b408f68" alt="Image">

To make querying easier, we need to:
- Create temporary table for pizza_recipes
- Splitting comma dilimited lists into rows
