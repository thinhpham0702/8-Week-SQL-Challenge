	 , sa.order_date
	 , CASE	WHEN mu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN mu.price * 10 * 2
			WHEN sa.order_date < me.join_date THEN mu.price * 10
			WHEN sa.order_date BETWEEN me.join_date AND me.join_date + interval '6 day' THEN mu.price * 10 * 2
			WHEN sa.order_date > me.join_date + interval '6 day' THEN mu.price * 10 END AS points
	FROM members me
	JOIN sales sa
	 ON me.customer_id = sa.customer_id
	JOIN menu mu
	 ON mu.product_id = sa.product_id
	WHERE DATE_PART('month', sa.order_date) = 1

FROM item_point
GROUP BY 1
```

#### Output

### Bonus Questions

**Q1. Create a data table that Danny and his team can use to quickly derive insights**

```sql
SELECT sa.customer_id
	 , sa.order_date
	 , mu.product_name
	 , mu.price
	 , CASE WHEN sa.order_date < me.join_date THEN 'N' 
			WHEN sa.order_date >= me.join_date THEN 'Y'
			ELSE 'N' END AS membership
	FROM sales sa
	LEFT JOIN members me
	 ON me.customer_id = sa.customer_id
	JOIN menu mu
	 ON sa.product_id = mu.product_id
	ORDER BY 1,2
 ```
 
#### Output
 
| customer_id | order_date | product_name | price | membership |
|-------------|------------|--------------|-------|------------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | sushi        | 10    | N          |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | curry        | 15    | N          |
| A           | 2021-01-07 | curry        | 15    | Y          |
| A           | 2021-01-10 | ramen        | 12    | Y          |
| A           | 2021-01-11 | ramen        | 12    | Y          |

| C           | 2021-01-07 | ramen        | 12    | N          |

**Q2. Danny also requires further information about the ranking of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ranking values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program**

```sql
WITH customer_data AS (
	SELECT sa.customer_id
	 , sa.order_date
	 , mu.product_name
	 , mu.price
	 , CASE WHEN sa.order_date < me.join_date THEN 'N' 
			WHEN sa.order_date >= me.join_date THEN 'Y'
			ELSE 'N' END AS membership
	FROM sales sa
	LEFT JOIN members me
	 ON me.customer_id = sa.customer_id
	JOIN menu mu
	 ON sa.product_id = mu.product_id
	ORDER BY 1,2
	)

SELECT *
 , CASE WHEN membership = 'N' THEN NULL
 		ELSE rank() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id, membership ORDER BY order_date) END AS ranking
FROM customer_data
```

#### Output

| customer_id | order_date | product_name | price | membership | ranking |
|-------------|------------|--------------|-------|------------|---------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | sushi        | 10    | N          | NULL    |

| A           | 2021-01-11 | ramen        | 12    | Y          | 3       |

| B           | 2021-01-02 | curry        | 15    | N          | NULL    |
| B           | 2021-01-04 | sushi        | 10    | N          | NULL    |

| B           | 2021-01-16 | ramen        | 12    | Y          | 2       |
| B           | 2021-02-01 | ramen        | 12    | Y          | 3       |

| C           | 2021-01-07 | ramen        | 12    | N          | NULL    |
