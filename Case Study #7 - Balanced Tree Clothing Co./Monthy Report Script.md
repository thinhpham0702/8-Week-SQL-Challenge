# üõçÔ∏èCase Study #7 - Balanced Tree Clothing Co.

First, create a temporary table `monthly_sales` in a particular month (Ex: January 2021)

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE monthly_sales AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM balanced_tree.sales
	WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM start_txn_time) = 1
  AND   EXTRACT(year FROM start_txn_time) = 2021
	);
```

### High Level Sales Analysis
**1. What was the total quantity sold for all products?**
```sql
SELECT SUM(qty) total_qty
FROM monthly_sales
```

**2. What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?**
```sql
SELECT SUM(qty*price) AS revenue
FROM monthly_sales
```

```sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(price*qty*(discount::numeric/100)),2) AS total_discount_amount
FROM monthly_sales
```

FROM (
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FILTER(WHERE member = 'true') AS member_count
		, COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FILTER(WHERE member = 'false') AS non_member_count
	FROM monthly_sales
	) AS t1;
```

**6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?**
```sql
SELECT member
	, ROUND(AVG(total_rev),2) AS avg_rev
FROM (
	SELECT member
		, txn_id
		, SUM(price*qty) AS total_rev
	FROM monthly_sales
	GROUP BY 1,2
	) AS t1
GROUP BY 1;
```
