### Reporting Challenge
Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate the previous month‚Äôs values.

Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (which is also Danny) has asked for all of these questions at the end of every month.

He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to demonstrate that you can easily run the samne analysis for February without many changes (if at all).

Feel free to split up your final outputs into as many tables as you need - but be sure to explicitly reference which table outputs relate to which question for full marks :)

Here is [monthly_report_script]()

### Bonus Challenge
**Use a single SQL query to transform the product_hierarchy and product_prices datasets to the product_details table.**
```sql
WITH product_cte AS (
	SELECT h1.id AS style_id
		, h1.level_text AS style_name
		, h2.id AS segment_id
		, h2.level_text AS segment_name
		, h3.id AS category_id
		, h3.level_text AS category_name
	FROM balanced_tree.product_hierarchy h1
	LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_hierarchy h2
		ON h1.parent_id = h2.id
	LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_hierarchy h3
		ON h2.parent_id = h3.id
	)
		
SELECT p1.product_id, p1.price
	, CONCAT(p2.style_name,' ',p2.segment_name,' - ',p2.category_name) AS product_name
	, p2.category_id, p2.segment_id, p2.style_id, p2.category_name, p2.segment_name, p2.style_name 
FROM balanced_tree.product_prices p1
JOIN product_cte p2
	ON p1.id = p2.style_id;
```

#### Output:
